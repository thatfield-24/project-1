    <p>Welcome to the home page of my first project for ITMD 361. This course is required for my major but web development has always interests me greatly. So far the course has been a nice refresher on HTML after it has been a few years without using it; however, I hope to continue refreshing and building on my knowledge of HTML.</p>
	<p>The pages of this website showcase the classes and work experience I have as well as some of my personal interests.</p>
	<p>I am active on LinkedIn always looking to connect others with similar goals. Feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-hatfield/">connect</a> with me.</p>
	<p>Outside of my professional page on LinkedIn I also have an Instagram page that I post my vacation photos on. Take a look at those below.</p>
